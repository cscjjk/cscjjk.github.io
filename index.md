## Brief introduction

  I joined SYSU (School of Intelligent Systems Engineering) on July 2020,  
    as a member of *Hundred talents program of Sun Yat sen University*.  
  Previously, I was a postdoc in HKU (2016-2018) and in HKUST (2018-2020).  
  
  I am most interested in solving open problems that have clean definitions in theoretical computer science. My current research area includes:  
     - **Computational Geometry**  
     - **Game Theory**  
     - **Algorithm Design**  
     - **Combinatorics**  
     - **Discrete and Convex Geometry**
     
  I want to recruit self-motivated (master) students who are good at mathematics or computer programming.

## Education background
    B.S., Special Pilot CS Class (YAO class), Tsinghua University (2008）
    Ph.D, Theoretical Computer Science, Tsinghua University (2016)  
    My supervisor is Prof Andrew C. Yao. My PhD. Thesis is shown in the following.

## Ongoing projects  
  1. I am looking for more applications of my technique for solving the polygon inclusion problems.  
  2. I am working with Prof Siu-Wing Cheng (HKUST) on *self-improving algorithms*.  
  3. I am revising some previous results given in conference papers (e.g. AAMAS'19, ISAAC'16).
  4. I am attracted by some open problems in game theory and will study them recently.
  I am particularly interested in cooperation and competition between multiple players.
  5. I am trying to extend the results given in my PhD. dissertation to the 3d case.
  6. I am working on several geometric optimization problems.
